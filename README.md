# FDBMS-Final-Project-Group1
FDBMS_GEPHI_ENDPROJECT
A project on Neural Network of C. Elegan. This is a neural network of neurons and synapses in C. elegans, a type of worm.

NODES: 297

EDGES: 2148

Neural Network Algorithms used - Fruchterman Reingold, Force Atlas 2, Measures of centrality like betweenness, Density report and modularity were also calculated.

Conclusion:
The last image suggests that the dataset has many items which are interrelated to each other and the neural networks of C. Elegan are having a strong relationship with each other. There are 5 communities and filtering them suggests that the top 3 communities are bonded strong enough
